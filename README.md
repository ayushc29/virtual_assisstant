# Chat Application

## Overview
This project is a simple chat application developed in Java. It allows users to interact with a chatbot using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing. The chatbot uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model to generate responses based on user input.

## Features
- Graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing for user interaction.
- Integration with OpenAI GPT-3.5 for generating chatbot responses.
- Basic security measures implemented using the java.security package for cryptographic operations.

## Dependencies
- OpenAI API: For accessing the GPT-3.5 model for generating chatbot responses.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): For compiling and running the Java code.
- Swing: Java GUI toolkit used for building the user interface.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac` command.
3. Run the Chat.java file to launch the application.
4. Enter your username and password to log in (if applicable).
5. Use the text field to type messages and click "Send" to interact with the chatbot.

## File Structure
- Chat.java: Main class containing the GUI and chatbot interaction logic.
- UserSystem.java: Class handling user authentication and management.
